# Sudoku
This is a sudoku game done in C++ and using the ge211 library

There were 10 key points to address in this project:

1. Create a grid that has 9 rows and 9 columns.

2. Each row will be a list of 9 numbers from 1 to 9 and it cannot have repeated numbers.

3. Each column will be a list of 9 numbers from 1 to 9 and it cannot have repeated numbers.

4. Each 3x3 grid also has to contain 1 to 9 numbers with no repeated numbers. This will resemble a sudoku 9x9 grid.

5. To select an open cell, the player click on an open square with the cursor.

6. To enter a value into the cell, the user types in the number using the keyboard.

7. If this number does not work within the sudoku rules, then box will turn red and the box stays empty.

8. Once the correct number is entered into the cell, then the box will turn yellow.

9. The user cannot change the number after it has turned yellow.

10. When the 9x9 grid is correctly finished, all the yellow will turn into green indicating that the game is beat.
